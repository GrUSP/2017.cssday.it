    track: 1
    extract: >
      This talk is intermediate level and should have a bit of something
      for everyone whether you’re building a standard pipeline (non-docker)
      or already have a pipeline and looking to see how docker will make it even stronger.
      I will demonstrate how building pipe- lines with Docker differs from
      traditional pipelines, what steps are involved in migrating.
